# Crypto Juice Exchange - Project Context

## Project Overview
A production-quality React cryptocurrency tracking application deployed to AWS S3 via Terraform. Built for PGR301 students to demonstrate modern web development + infrastructure as code.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom glass-morphism effects
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and effects
- **Charts**: Recharts for interactive price charts
- **State Management**: React Query for API data, localStorage for portfolio
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform + AWS S3 static website hosting

## Key Features
1. **Live Data**: Real crypto prices from CoinGecko API (updates every 30s)
2. **News Feed**: Live crypto news from CryptoCompare API
3. **Interactive Charts**: Historical price data with 24h/7d/30d/1y timeframes
4. **Portfolio Tracker**: LocalStorage-based portfolio with profit/loss calculations
5. **Beautiful Animations**: Framer Motion page transitions, hover effects, loading states

## APIs Used (No Keys Required)
- **CoinGecko**: `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3` - Prices, market cap, volume, historical data
- **CryptoCompare**: `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/v2` - News articles

## Common Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # Production build to dist/
npm run preview      # Preview production build

# Deployment (from parent directory)
terraform init       # Initialize Terraform
terraform plan       # Preview infrastructure changes
terraform apply      # Deploy to AWS S3
terraform destroy    # Tear down all resources
```

## Deployment Flow
1. Build React app: `cd s3_demo_website && npm run build && cd ..`
2. Deploy to AWS: `terraform apply`
3. Terraform uploads `dist/` contents to S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
4. Access via S3 website URL output from Terraform

## Important Files
- `../main.tf` - Terraform configuration (S3 bucket, website config, IAM policies)
- `src/App.tsx` - Main app with tabbed interface (Market, Charts, News, Portfolio)
- `src/services/api.ts` - Axios API calls to CoinGecko and CryptoCompare
- `src/hooks/useCryptoData.ts` - React Query hook for crypto prices
- `src/hooks/usePortfolio.ts` - LocalStorage-based portfolio management
- `tailwind.config.js` - Custom theme with neon blue/purple colors

## Known Issues & Solutions
- **"AccessDenied" during bucket policy**: Timing issue, just run `terraform apply` again
- **Bucket name conflict**: Edit `website_bucket_name` variable in `main.tf`
- **API rate limits**: CoinGecko allows 10-30 calls/min, app refreshes every 30s

## Build Output
- Production build: ~238 KB gzipped JS, ~3.76 KB CSS
- 4 files uploaded to S3: index.html, JS bundle, CSS, favicon
- Build time: ~2-3 seconds

## Cost
- Typical demo usage: **< $0.01/month** on AWS
- Mainly S3 storage and minimal data transfer costs

## Design Philosophy
- Dark theme with neon accents (blue/purple gradient)
- Glass-morphism cards with blur effects
- Smooth animations throughout
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Professional UI/UX to impress students

## Cryptocurrency List
App tracks 6 major cryptocurrencies mapped as "juice flavors":
- Bitcoin (BTC) - Orange
- Ethereum (ETH) - Purple
- Cardano (ADA) - Blue
- Solana (SOL) - Magenta
- Polkadot (DOT) - Pink
- Dogecoin (DOGE) - Yellow

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Add CloudFront + HTTPS for CDN
- Custom domain with Route53
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Price alerts with notifications
- Social sharing of portfolio
- More chart types (candlestick)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
